# Paper 2: Navigating college enrollment during the COVID-19 pandemic: examining the effectiveness of an artificially intelligent chatbot in helping students navigate the road to college

## Introduction

In spring 2020, schools and colleges across the US began to shut down and pivot to remote learning to protect students and their communities from the rapid spread of the COVID-19 virus. While all the while, high school seniors began receiving acceptance letters from the colleges to which they had applied before the pandemic. At the time, the effect of the pandemic on college-going was uncertain. On the one hand, the COVID-19 crisis hampered business-as-usual operating procedures for colleges. Because of this, students -- particularly those planning to live on campus -- may have been more likely to delay college entry. On the other hand, higher education is a counter-cyclical industry such that college enrollment rates tend to be higher during economic downturns. For recent high school graduates, in particular, the impact of the pandemic on service and retail, among other sectors, may severely limit job opportunities. This, in turn, may make higher education an attractive option for young adults who might otherwise enter the labor market after high school.

In response to this uncertainty, the Common Application (Common App), in partnership with Mainstay and the College Advising Corps (CAC), acted quickly to provide students with proactive outreach and guidance on college-going tasks via an innovative large-scale artificially intelligent (AI) chatbot campaign. This outreach targeted nearly 174,000 US high school students who were the first in their families to go to college and came from underresourced families, most of whom were racially marginalized (83%). Due to an array of systemic barriers, this subgroup of students likely faced reduced access to quality health care, living, and work conditions during the pandemic (CITE) and, therefore, would likely benefit from additional support during their precarious college transition.

Over 38 weeks, a Mainstay AI chatbot named *Oli* sent scripted messages to students on various topics related to the college search, application, and matriculation processes. To better target the information, Oli solicited information directly from students about the types of resources they needed and pressing questions they had. The chatbot "learned" from these students' interactions and developed a knowledge base to provide more targeted and individualized real-time responses. Student questions that Oli could not answer were forwarded to college advisers, who would follow up directly with individual students.

In recent years, researchers have become increasingly interested in leveraging behavioral economics insights to evaluate the effectiveness of AI chatbots in helping students transition to and through college (CITE). These studies have demonstrated that AI chatbots deployed within a local university context are effective in assisting students complete pre-matriculation tasks and ultimately enroll in college (Page..Gelbach..Aizat..2017;2020;2021). However, many questions remain about the scalability of AI chatbot interventions. Previous research has highlighted that non-chatbot nudge interventions fail to maintain efficacy when scaled to a national level, with many finding modest to null effects on college enrollment (CITE). 

Therefore, the aim of my second dissertation is to add to the literature on the scalability of AI chatbot campaigns by evaluating the effectiveness of a large-scale AI chatbot campaign that targeted first-generation, low-income students. Specifically, I focus on whether the outreach campaign resulted in more students applying to and enrolling in college. In addition, I explore heterogeneity in outreach impact on college enrollment by students' application behavior, racial/ethnic subgroups, and level of engagement with the chatbot.

In the following sections, I review the relevant literature for this study, followed by a description of the data and the analytical strategy that I employ. I end by presenting preliminary results of the evaluation.

## Literature Review

In this section, I review the literature on college access broadly and during the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, I draw on literature addressing barriers to college access for high school students through behavioral text message nudge interventions and chatbots.

However, before reviewing the literature, I want to define how I conceptualize first-generation students. I take an anti-deficit approach to my grounding of first-generation students -- many of whom also tend to be economically and racially marginalized (CITE). Anti-deficit practices explore how marginalized students persist in the face of social and structural barriers (CITE, Harper). The goal is to reframe students' experiences from struggling to ones of resiliency. Since most deficit approaches focus on what students lack, anti-deficit strategies focus on what students bring that leads to their resiliency and persistence. Although I take an anti-deficit stance in my review of the literature, I acknowledge that most existing literature around college access, especially literature focused on economically and racially marginalized students, is written from a deficit perspective (CITE).

### College access and returns to a college education

Despite increasing access to higher education in recent decades, there remain disparities in college attainment by socioeconomic status and parental education (CITE). Students whose parents received a college degree enroll in college at higher rates than those parents who did not complete high school (CITE). Additionally, students from higher-income backgrounds are more likely to enroll and complete postsecondary education than students from less-resourced families (CITE). For example, around 13% of students from the lowest income brackets earn a bachelor's degree by age 24, compared to 64% of students from the highest income brackets (CITE). However, much of the quantitative literature fails to acknowledge systemic barriers and the role of US policies in creating these disparities.

Lower-income and particularly racially marginalized people face structural challenges in accessing quality education, housing, and working conditions (CITE). For example, decades of federal redlining in housing and the policy of using local taxes to fund schools creates raced and classed outcomes in educational opportunities and family wealth (CITE). Therefore, disparities in college access and completion by parental education -- along with social and structural barriers -- are vital contributors to the growing income inequality in the US.

Despite the rising cost of college (CITE), the non-pecuniary and long-term economic returns to a college education remain positive. Adults who earn a bachelor's degree tend to earn and accumulate more wealth than those who have not completed college (CITE). On average, individuals with a college degree have lower unemployment rates, higher civic involvement, and better health outcomes (CITE). However, researchers note that the rate of economic return is substantially higher for continuing education students than for first-generation students (CITE). Given that more than half of all college students identify as first-generation (56%), substantial policy efforts have focused on supporting college-intending first-generation students to enroll in college (CITE). However, the COVID-19 pandemic has added additional complexity to the college enrollment process for first-generation students.

### College access during the COVID-19 pandemic

The COVID-19 pandemic increased the uncertainty for high school seniors who planned to enroll in college in fall of 2020. In the early stages of the pandemic, one in six recent high school graduates reported rethinking their decision to enroll in college, and nearly two-thirds expressed concern about attending their first choice college (CITE). The most cited reason for not enrolling in their first choice school was concern about their family's ability to afford college (CITE).

Now, nearly three years into the pandemic, we have some evidence of the detrimental effects of the pandemic on college-going. Enrollment for first-time undergraduates in fall 2020 fell to unprecedented levels, dropping nearly ten percentage points compared to fall 2019, with higher rates for students from low-income high schools (CITE). Furthermore, students from low-minority schools were more likely to immediately enroll in college than those from high schools with more diverse student bodies, 64% versus 52%, respectively (CITE).

A recent report by the College Board provides additional details on the detrimental effects of the pandemic on college enrollment. Drawing on data from nearly 10 million US students, the College Board calculated high-level descriptives and regression-adjusted models identifying the portion of fall 2020 enrollment rates attributable to COVID-19. The most significant change in student enrollment occurred within community colleges, where enrollment rates decreased by nearly 12% due to the pandemic. Most worrying is that enrollment rates fell mainly for first-generation low-income students (CITE).

A likely reason for the drop in college enrollment rates for first-generation students is the pandemics' disproportionate effect on racially and economically marginalized communities. During the pandemic, these communities experienced reduced access to high-quality healthcare and working conditions and lower expected wages (CITE). Before the pandemic, the typical Black and Latinx household had a net wealth of approximately $17,000 compared to $171,000 held by the typical white household (CITE). Therefore, Black and Latinx households may have found it more difficult to cope with the economic shock caused by the pandemic. These households had to grapple with less liquidity and wealth to cover unexpected expenses and loss in wages (CITE, Center for american progress). This, in turn, may have caused first-generation students to prioritize immediate health and economic stressors, such as supporting their families financially or dealing with lost wages, rather than prioritizing college enrollment. Data from the College Board may support this hypothesis. Students from higher-income households were far more likely to enroll in college immediately after graduation (65%) than those from low-income high schools (49%). Furthermore, first-generation students were nearly twice as likely to be concerned about paying for education expenses in fall 2020 than continuing education students (CITE). The review of the literature highlights the unprecedented change in college enrollment caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly for first-generation, economically and racially marginalized students. Next, I review the literature on well-documented challenges to college access.

### Challenges in college access 

Considerable research attention has been paid to the barriers in college application, financing, and enrollment processes, especially for students who are the first in their families to go to college (CITE). To apply for college, students must complete a series of complex tasks such as developing a list of colleges, deciding which colleges to apply to, and applying for financial aid through a cumbersome financial aid application (the Free Application for Federal Financial Aid - FAFSA). Students typically access federal, state, and grant aid -- aid that *does not* have to be repaid -- by completing the FAFSA form, which has more than 100 questions that ask students about their and their families' financial assets.

Many scholars have stressed the importance of supporting students in completing and submitting the FAFSA, since a sizable portion of first-generation students come from less-resourced families and, therefore, must rely on financial support to finance their post-secondary aspirations (CITE). Scholars have argued that due to federal and state divestment from funding postsecondary institutions, the focus has changed from need-based grants to merit-based aid and loans (CITE). This shift has negatively impacted first-generation and low-income students (Long & Riley, 2007).

Several studies have shown how supporting students in submitting the FAFSA has led to positive college enrollment outcomes (CITE). For example, a recent clustered randomized trial by Castleman and Page (2019) demonstrated that supporting students in completing the FAFSA led to an increase of 6 percentage points in FAFSA submission and completion rates and an increase in college enrollment of around 3 percentage points. However, helping students submit the FAFSA is only half the battle. For a subset of students -- primarily first-generation and low-income students -- their FAFSA is selected for further scrutiny by a process termed verification. Verification requires students to attest and provide documentation that the information reported on their FAFSA is correct (CITE). Scholars have recently discovered that verification leads to lower college matriculation rates, particularly for first-generation low-income students (CITE). However, once a student accepts an admission offer, additional barriers remain to college enrollment, especially in the summer before college.

Scholars have suggested that the summer before college enrollment is fraught with additional barriers to college matriculation (CITE). Given that students must complete a series of pre-matriculation administrative tasks, including submitting high school transcripts, deciding which and how much aid to accept, taking placement exams, and successfully enrolling in classes (CITE). If students do not complete these steps, they may eventually fail to enroll in college, a process termed "summer melt" (CITE). Researchers have found that summer melt affects 10 to 20% of college-intending high school students, with higher rates for first-generation, racially, and economically marginalized students (CITE) who may lack access to information and support to help navigate these complex administrative tasks (CITE).

### Unique challenges in college access among first-generation students

However, for first-generation students, there is an added layer of complexity in navigating these tasks with little to no access to social and cultural capital around the college application process. For example, scholars have emphasized how first-generation students tend to reside in schools with less access to college prep or Advanced Placement (AP) courses, which have been positively associated with college enrollment (CITE). Additionally, first-generation students tend to attend schools with little or no access to college counselors, which could help students complete college applications and navigate the complex financial aid process (CITE). However, even when students have access to a college counselor, these counselors are burdened with high caseloads and cannot provide individualized support to students (CITE).

In addition, first-generation students who are racially marginalized must endure social and systemic barriers and policies that traditionally left them with less access to high-quality primary and secondary education (CITE). For example, policies that funnel racially marginalized students into underserved schools, with limited access to college prep courses, and school tracking policies that exclude racially marginalized students from gaining access to the college prep tracks that would make them eligible to apply to college (Oakes, 2005; Oakes, Rogers, Lipton, & Morell, 2002; Solorzano & Ornelas, 2002, 2004). Additionally, due to decades of systemic oppression, these students have less access to intergenerational wealth, which could finance college. Therefore, they must rely on financial aid to fund their postsecondary education (CITE). However, substantial interventions have focused on supporting these students in completing pre-matriculation tasks by providing access to college advising (CITE).

### College advising as a tool to increase college access

A rich body of literature has evaluated the effectiveness of behavioral interventions that examine ways to support students in completing the key steps and deadlines to enroll in college. One favored approach to remedying students' information asymmetries in the college-going process is access to high-quality college advising that can support students' transition to college. 

Empirical evidence confirms that providing student access to college advising positively affects college enrollment and persistence (CITE). Castleman et al. (2012) provide one of the earliest pieces of evidence of the positive impact of providing college counseling to low-income students during the summer before college. Through a randomized trial, Castleman et al. show that offering college counseling support in the summer before college increases student immediate college enrollment by 14 percentage points. However, this study was conducted with "choice" schools. Therefore, open questions remained about whether this kind of support generalized to public schools.

However, a similar study by Castleman, Page and Schooley (2014) provided evidence of the generalizability of counseling support within public schools. The researcher conducted two college counseling interventions with a more nationally representative sample of public schools in Boston and Fulton County, Georgia. They found positive effects similar to those of the previous study by Castleman et al. (2012). Students who received proactive college counseling in the summer before college had an increase in college enrollment, from 8 to 12 percentage points among low-income students. However, in the context of a global pandemic, access to college counseling was severely impacted.

Against the backdrop of a global pandemic, students faced challenges in accessing quality college advising. Naughton (2021) describes the difficulties in college advising during the pandemic as turning preexisting "cracks" in the ability to provide students advising services into "craters." This is primarily driven by the transition of high schools from in person to virtual advising. Naughton found that college advisors felt ineffective in providing virtual support and guidance once high schools transitioned to virtual advising. The ability of advisors to contact students was severely diminished and left students without support to facilitate their college transition (CITE). Naughton explains that advisers in high schools with higher college enrollment rates were far less impacted than students in lower college enrollment high schools, precisely those needing the most support (CITE). Therefore, approaches that bring college counseling directly to students who need it most are crucial, especially virtual support.

### Behavioral nudge interventions - summer melt

A low-cost approach to providing college students with counseling support has been behavioral nudge interventions. These interventions distill complex information and deadlines into short, concise messages delivered to students via a mode of communication that students are well aware of -- text messages (CITE). In the context of college access, these studies have focused on remedying "summer melt" by helping students navigate well-defined but complex tasks such as completing financial aid applications, submitting high school transcripts, and enrolling in classes (CITE).

Castleman and Page (DATE) have conducted several randomized controlled studies utilizing text nudges to remedy summer melt. For example, Castleman and Page (2015) employ an automated and personalized text message campaign to "nudge" students on pre-matriculation tasks. They found that the text message campaign increased college enrollment among students with less access to college access support by approximately 7 percentage points. The authors and other scholars have highlighted the relatively low cost of these text nudge interventions as opposed to more intensive in-person counselor support (CITE). The low-cost nature of these interventions has spurred an interest in using nudge interventions in the last 10 years (CITE). However, the evidence on the scalability of these interventions is mixed.

A recent line of research has explored the scalability of behavioral text nudge interventions, given that most large college access nudge interventions partner with local high schools, colleges, or non-profits (CITE). A recent study by Bird et al. (2021) offered evidence that nudges may be unsuccessful when scaled up. Bird and colleagues examined student nudges using multiple modalities, including email and text messages, that encouraged students to complete the FAFSA and enroll in college. What made this study unique is the sheer number of students targeted, nearly 800,000 students across the US using the Common App or the Texas admission system. The researchers found that no form of outreach (i.e., email or text message) increased financial aid receipt, college enrollment, or persistence. A suggested reason for this finding is that scaling nudge campaigns can be challenging when implemented by a large organization, since the student may not have a solid connection to a large organization like the Common App as opposed to their local high school. Additionally, the author's reason that in order to deliver nudges to a broad group of students, the messaging may be too "generic and one-way" and lack personalization, leading to students not taking actionable steps to enroll in college. However, recent studies have used technological advances to help close this personalization divide. 

### AI chatbots in college access

A recent push in the behavioral nudge literature has been to leverage artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots to provide personalized support to students navigating college applications and enrollment. These AI conversational chatbots can provide personalized information to students about deadlines and specific college-going questions. These AI bots are trained by college staff to develop a "bank" of responses to frequently asked questions about college-going. Over time, the AI "learns" how to handle increasingly complex student queries. Once successfully trained and deployed to students, the chatbot can help students answer questions about important deadlines, such as how to submit their high school transcripts.

A total of three studies to date have provided empirical evidence of the effectiveness of AI chatbots in college access (CITE). Page and Gelbach (2017) conducted the first of these studies at Georgia State University (GSU). Page and Gelbach partnered with GSU and an ed-tech start-up (Mainstay; formerly AdmitHub) to create an AI conversation chatbot named "Pounce." Pounce provided support in navigating pre-matriculation tasks to students accepted to GSU in 2017. The researchers found that the chatbot led to a 3.3 percentage point increase in timely enrollment at GSU and helped students with pre-matriculation tasks like signing up for orientation.

A follow-up study at GSU (Page et al., 2022) shifted the focus of the chatbot outreach from helping students enroll at GSU to supporting them once they arrived at GSU by assisting them in completing administrative processes, such as resolving registration holds and seeking campus-based resources (CITE). A novel aspect of this randomized study was its focus on the main campus of GSU-Atlanta, a four-year institution, and the perimeter campus of GSU, a two-year institution. Researchers found that regardless of institution type, the chatbot effectively changed student behavior when outreach addressed serious and time-sensitive administrative processes, such as resolving administrative holds (CITE). However, they found that outreach was ineffective when chatbot messaging focused on helping students with "non-urgent" tasks such as accessing supplemental, academic, social, and career-related support. This study provides evidence that chatbot interventions are most effective when they target discrete, time-sensitive, and well-defined tasks. These findings parallel findings from previous text-nudge interventions that have found students were less responsive to nudges related to less time-sensitive tasks such as future-job prospects (CITE). However, it is important to note that both studies mentioned previously occurred within the GSU system. Therefore, an open question was whether the positive effects of AI chatbot intervention replicate to other institutions outside the GSU system. 

However, Nushatayeva et al. (2021) argue that context matters regarding chatbot interventions for college access. Nushatayeva and colleagues replicate the work of Page and Gelbach (2017) and Page et al. (2022) using "PeeDee," an AI chatbot at East Carolina University (ECU), a four-year institution in North Carolina. Furthermore, this study provides evidence of treatment heterogeneity by understanding to whom and under what conditions the intervention was most effective. Researches test the use of PeeDee in improving students' completion of pre-matriculation tasks and ultimate college enrollment at ECU. They find no overall effect of the chatbot on college enrollment but did find an impact on loan acceptance rates. Students in the treatment group had an 8 percentage point increase in accepting a student loan compared to the control group. Nushatayeva et al. attribute the null overall results on college enrollment to the relatively advantaged student body at ECU versus GSU. However, the authors find that the chatbot increased enrollment at ECU and course enrollment by 3 percentage points, specifically for first-generation students.

Together, these studies provide evidence on the effectiveness of AI bots in helping students transition into and through college. However, chatbot-based nudges are not uniformly effective across various contexts. The literature points to these interventions being most salient when chatbots help nudge students on time-sensitive, actionable tasks, such as resolving registration holds. In addition, chatbot outreach is most effective at helping students with little prior knowledge about college application or enrollment, that is, first-generation students. These findings parallel the results of the much more mature literature on general nudges in college access -- context matters. However, little is known about the scalability of these types of interventions outside universities, such as at the national level targeting hundreds of thousands of students.
