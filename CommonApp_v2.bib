Despite cultural commitments to equality and justice, the US educational system continues to provide clear and consistent advantages for white and wealthier Americans and disadvantages for low-income, students of color. This paper explores why efforts to equalize education have fared so poorly and how US schools and society might become more equitable and just. Our conclusions are straightforward: Equity reforms rarely take hold because they rely on conventional, technical approaches to policymaking and educational change. Instead, equitable, high-quality schooling for all students will likely fare better with social movement activism that addresses the societal norms and politics which cement the status quo. At the heart of such activism is a process we call “learning power.” (The ideas presented here are presented more fully in Jeannie Oakes and John Rogers, Learning Power: Organizing for Education and Justice (New York: Teachers College Press, 2006).)}},

Using data from 2014, we estimate that compliance costs to institutions in that year totaled nearly US\$500 million with the burden falling disproportionately on public institutions and community colleges, in particular.

Specifically, the study explored how parents augmented—or at times, undermined—students’ self-determination toward college, as evidenced by students’ feelings of relatedness, competency, and autonomy. Results showed that students’ self-determination was enhanced when parents were involved in college planning, served as positive examples, set high academic standards early, and fostered students’ sense of career volition. Motivation was undermined when families limited students’ choices, did not set clear expectations for college going, provided little feedback, or emphasized family obligations.

We performed PS 1:1 nearest-neighbor matching on each sample. We calculated standardized mean differences across groups to detect any remaining imbalance in the matched samples. We examined 25 thresholds (from 0.01 to 0.25, stepwise 0.01) for considering residual imbalance. The treatment effect was estimated using logistic regression that contained only those covariates considered to be unbalanced by these thresholds. We showed that regression adjustment could dramatically remove residual confounding bias when it included all of the covariates with a standardized difference greater than 0.10. The additional benefit was negligible when we also adjusted for covariates with less imbalance. We found that the mean squared error of the estimates was minimized under the same conditions. If covariate balance is not achieved, we recommend reiterating PS modeling until standardized differences below 0.10 are achieved on most covariates. In case of remaining imbalance, a double adjustment might be worth considering.}},

The very idea that Latina/o students possess cultural capital is new to higher education, which has historically undervalued Latina/o student experience and community history. Cultural capital, however, plays a crucial role in Latina/o student academic achievement. The authors’ study of junior- and senior-level Latina/o students attending a primarily White four-year research university in the Midwest examines Latina/o community cultural wealth, particularly with regard to navigating the academy.

We also noted four themes reflecting resilience, including how SEA found a sanctuary through a campus program, gave back to similar others, reframed stigmatization, and gained personal strength through networks. An anti-deficit framework helped identify how SEA are leveraging their community strengths and past experiences to thrive in institutions still not fully prepared to serve them.

An online survey was conducted among undergraduate and graduate students recruited from Texas A\&M University via email. The survey consisted of two standardized scales—the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 and the General Anxiety Disorder-7—for depression and anxiety, and additional multiple-choice and open-ended questions regarding stressors and coping mechanisms specific to COVID-19. Among the 2031 participants, 48.14\% (n=960) showed a moderate-to-severe level of depression, 38.48\% (n=775) showed a moderate-to-severe level of anxiety, and 18.04\% (n=366) had suicidal thoughts. A majority of participants (n=1443, 71.26\%) indicated that their stress/anxiety levels had increased during the pandemic. Less than half of the participants (n=882, 43.25\%) indicated that they were able to cope adequately with the stress related to the current situation. The proportion of respondents showing depression, anxiety, and/or suicidal thoughts is alarming. Respondents reported academic-, health-, and lifestyle-related concerns caused by the pandemic.

The authors propose that chatbots can be a useful tool for helping students navigate the volumes of information that confront them as they begin attending university, while at the same time feeling somewhat personally connected with the instructor. This is achieved without increasing instructor time commitment, and perhaps reducing it in large classes. The paper reveals the results of applying this tool in a large first year class and proposes improvements for future iterations. A tool was designed and implemented and tested against research insights. Chatbots are an effective means to reduce student transition challenges. Technology which feels social and personal as well as functioning on a tool that students use will make the student feel more connected to the course and the instructor. Tools aiding transition should be easy to use and allow customizable information access. Chatbots are an unexplored tool. They have the benefit of addressing information overload as well as making the student feel socially connected without increasing instructor workload.}},

However, this results in a deficit-based approach to the study of FGCSs that tends to highlight the differences between first-generation and continuing-education students. However, FGCSs possess a wealth of resources from parents and families that make them successful, and that are often ignored in research. Asset-based approaches to the study of FGCSs are becoming more frequent in the form of books, book chapters, and white papers; however, published empirical research has yet to adopt this approach. As a result, a deeper understanding of FGCSs’ experiences is essential to advancing diversity and equity in higher education. To begin to address this gap, a systematic literature review of empirical studies following the PRISMA framework was conducted on first generation college students and family support; the literature was critically reviewed and future directions for the field were identified. Applying a critical, cultural, and familial lens to the study of first-generation college students will contribute to reframing the research narrative towards an asset-based narrative.}},

I extend on previous literature on educational inequities to consider the structural forces that constrain educational opportunities. In particular, through the standpoint of Black women and girls, I rely on constructs such as the matrix of domination and controlling images to highlight the limits of college “choice.” The aim is to the examine the various ways “choice” is constrained for Black women and girls, in order to develop transformative mechanisms to improve access to adequate education, increase college participation, and enhance life opportunities.

The intervention utilized a mixture of automated and personalized text messages from academic advisors and allowed for two-way communication between individual students and their major advisor. Mulitvariate analyses revealed the intervention had no impact on university persistence, but it did increase the odds of persisting in the college to the end of the semester, moving the average, overall college persistence rate from 93 to 95\%. Effects were concentrated on underclass students, whose persistence rate moved from 87 to 93\% at the college level. Underclass students also showed statistically significant university persistence effects, moving from 90 to 95\%.

These two conceptualizations positioned first-generation college students against normative ways of learning, and in doing so promulgate an assimilation approach in higher education.

abstract = {{In the beginning of 2020, the novel Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, became a public health emergency in the U.S. and rapidly escalated into a global pandemic. Because the SARS-CoV-2 virus is highly contagious, physical distancing was enforced and indoor public spaces, including schools and educational institutions, were abruptly closed and evacuated to ensure civilian safety. Accordingly, educational institutions rapidly transitioned to remote learning. We investigated the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on domestic U.S. college students, ages 18–24 years. Through Pollfish®’s survey research platform, we collected data from 200 domestic U.S. college students in this age range (N = 200) regarding the physical, emotional, and social impacts of COVID-19 as well as key background information (e.g. whether or not they are first-generation or if they identify with the LGBTQIA+ community). Our results indicate that students closer to graduating faced increases in anxiety (60.8\%), feeling of loneliness (54.1\%), and depression (59.8\%). Many reported worries for the health of loved ones most impacted their mental health status (20.0\%), and the need to take care of family most affected current and future plans (31.8\%). Almost one-half of students took to exercising and physical activity to take care of their mental health (46.7\%). While a third did not have strained familial relationships (36.5\%), almost one half did (45.7\%). A majority found it harder to complete the semester at home (60.9\%), especially among those who had strained relationships with family (34.1\%). Seventy percent spent time during the pandemic watching television shows or movies. Significantly more men, first-generation, and low-income students gained beneficial opportunities in light of the pandemic, whereas their counterparts reported no impact. First-generation students were more likely to take a gap year or time off from school. Although students found ways to take care of themselves and spent more time at home, the clear negative mental health impacts call for schools and federal regulations to accommodate, support, and make mental health care accessible to all students.}},

We find that outreach policies are broadly effective in raising access of disadvantaged students when they include active counselling or simplify the university application process, but not when they only provide general information on higher education. In terms of financial aid, we find that need-based grants do not systematically raise enrolment rates but only lead to improvements when they provide enough money to cover unmet need and/or include an early commitment during high school. Still, need-based grants quite consistently appear to improve completion rates of disadvantaged students. In contrast, the evidence indicate that merit-based grants only rarely improve outcomes of disadvantaged students. Finally, interventions combining outreach and financial aid have brought promising results although more research on these mixed-interventions is still needed. We also discuss the theoretical implications of these findings for our understanding of the mechanisms driving social inequalities in higher education.}},

We find that the AI chatbot increased overall success with navigating financial aid processes, such that student take up of educational loans increased by four percentage points. This financial aid effect was concentrated among would-be first-generation college goers, for whom loan acceptances increased by eight percentage points. In addition, the outreach increased first-generation students’ success with course registration and fall semester enrollment each by three percentage points.

One intervention utilized an automated and personalized text messaging campaign to remind college-intending students of required pre-matriculation tasks and to connect them to counselor-based support. Another employed near-aged peer mentors to provide summer outreach and support. The interventions substantially increased college enrollment among students who had less academic-year access to quality college counseling or information.

abstract = {{The object of this study was to examine whether college-intending, low-income high school graduates are particularly susceptible to having their postsecondary education plans change, or even fall apart, during the summer after high school graduation. College access research has largely overlooked this time period. Yet, previous research indicates that a sizeable share of low-income students who had paid college deposits reconsidered where, and even whether, to enroll in the months following graduation. We assess the extent to which this phenomenon—commonly referred to as “summer melt”—is broadly generalizable. We employ two data sources, a national survey and administrative data from a large metropolitan area, and regression analysis to estimate the prevalence of summer melt. Our analyses reveal summer melt rates of sizeable magnitude: ranging from 8 to 40 percent. Our results indicate that low-income, college-intending students experience high rates of summer attrition from the college pipeline. Given the goal of improving the flow of low-income students to and through college, it is imperative to investigate how to effectively intervene and mitigate summer melt.}},
